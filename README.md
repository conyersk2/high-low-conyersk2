# High Low Game Assignment
Created the index.js file to contain the program that completes the assignment. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10 once the user prompts a new game to start. It then prompts the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. Depending on the user's response, the program 
will reply if the guess was too high, too low, or the same as the randomly generated number. The user may guess as many times as necessary to find the correct answer. The program will also return the number of games the user has won since the program was started whenever the user wins.

## Instructions
To use, run the program without an argument. For example, `node index.js`. Once the program is started, text 'new game' to the associated number. Once texted, the program will prompt the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. Use the responses provided by the program to 
guess until the correct number is found. Simply text 'new game' again to generate a new random number to guess.
